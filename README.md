 Any other device other than replit:<br />
 To install, make sure there is a file in your home and/or profile folder called "ccOSinst", you are able to delete this later.<br />
 Once the zip file is installed, unzip it in this new folder, run main.py in the folder. Say yes to the question then the installer will do the rest.<br />
 If you want you are able to delete the ccOSinst folder now.<br /><br />
